                Uruguay born and New Jersey raised, my life has been a thrilling adventure from the start.
                I currently call Jersey City home; sharing it with my amazing husband, Harrison, and my charmingly mischievous pup, Fuzz. <br/><br/>

                My journey has been anything but conventional. With a background that spans operations, event planning, graphic design, and illustration, I've cultivated a unique blend of skills and experiences. I'm a firm believer in seizing every opportunity and leveraging my diverse skill set to the fullest. I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments, and I'm always eager to embrace new challenges.<br/><br/>

                One of my core values is building meaningful relationshipsâ€”with clients, colleagues, and collaborators. I believe that strong connections are the foundation of successful ventures and personal growth.<br/><br/>

                When I'm not immersed in work or furthering my skills, you'll find me gliding through life on roller-skates, experimenting with new recipes, or immersing myself in the world of games. <br/><br/>

                If you're interested in connecting or exploring potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's chat and create something extraordinary together!<br/><br/> </p>
